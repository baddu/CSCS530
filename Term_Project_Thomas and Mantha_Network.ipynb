    "# 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to create an agent based model, that simulates the effects of dynamic occupant interactions and interventions such as variations in the building performance levels and frequent education programs in reducing the energy usage of the building. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why ABM for solving the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "There are dynamic occupant interactions and building manager interventions during the life time of a building which can affect the energy usage patterns in a building. To represent this dynamic nature, ABM provides the best solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will develop a simple model that:\n",
    "* uses object-oriented concepts, e.g., classes\n",
    "* implements an agent-based approach to Building Energy Modeling\n",
    "* demonstrates how an institution or norm set by Building Manager can influence the building systems efficiency and the energy use patterns of occupants. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Defining the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model, our space will be a two-dimensional (2D) square grid. Each grid cell will contain zero or one people. Edges of the grid will wrap around.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Actors \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "This Agent Based Model will have two different types of agents, \n",
    "* Building Occupants - who live and interact in the space (building) and\n",
    "* Building Managers - who are responsible for the dynamic interventions such as educational programs, building maintenance etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Institution\n",
    "\n",
    "In this model Building manager (one of the agents in this model) sets the institutions/ norms i.e. the frequency of maintenance activities and educational awareness programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Initial conditions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "* Building occupants will be randomly distributed throughout the grid by sampling from a uniform discrete distribution with replacement. In the event that an occupant has already been placed at the sampled location, we continue drawing a new nandom position until it is unoccupied.\n",
    "* Building occupants will have their probability of interaction randomly initialized to a value from any continuous distribution.\n",
    "* Building Managers have their probability of interventions randomly initialized. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Institutions\n",
    "\n",
    "* The building energy efficiency set to a default level of 100% at the start of the simualation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the description above, we need the following model parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    " * ``grid_size``: size of the two-dimensional square grid, i.e., dimension length of the space\n",
    " * ``population_size``: number of occupants in the building; must be less than ${grid\\_size}^2$\n",
    " * `` prob_interaction``: prabability of occupants interacting. \n",
    " \n",
    "### List of sweep parameters\n",
    " \n",
    " * ``population_size`` : keeping the space constant how population_size changes the energy usage in buildings\n",
    " * ``user_type`` : Initial percentage of low, medium, and high energy users\n",
    " * `` maintenance_frequency`` : The frequency of maintenance of the building\n",
    " * ``affect_AP `` affect of awareness programs on the occupants"
